# CS 211 Lab #2
The purpose of this lab is to get you started on your newly assigned first
programming assignment.  To that end, we will implement the following tasks:

## Task #1
In this task, you will read an indeterminate number of numbers from the
user.  Continue this process until you encounter any negative number. Once
this occurs, output the average of the series.  We will use this task to learn
more about vectors and obtaining data from a file.

## Task #2
In this task, you will be exposed to CSV file parsing.  You will work with
your classmates to output the contents of the PA #1 CSVs to the screen.

## Task #3
In this task, you will be introduced to the PPM image specification.  You
will then create a program that will allow the user to perform image
manipulations on a provided PPM file.
