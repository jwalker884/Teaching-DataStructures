# CS 211 Lab #1

This lab is meant to be an easy and fun refresher of C++.  To that end, your task is as follows:

Given an file containing an indeterminate quantity of integers, find the median number.  
For example, the following file has a median value of 2.

```code
1
2
3
```

Another example whose median value is 3

```code
3
3
1
1
7
4
```

This one has a median value of 5.5

```code
5
1
10
2
8
4
3
9
6
7
```

Here's another one (no answer given!):

```code
72
